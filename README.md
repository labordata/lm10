# Filings for Employers who hire Labor Relation Consultants or Pay Labor Officials

 Employers must file Form LM-10 annual reports to disclose financial dealings with a union or officer or with a labor relation consultant.

This repository gathers these reports from the [Office of Labor-Management Standards's Online Public Disclosure Room](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/olms/public-disclosure-room) and organized it into a database.
